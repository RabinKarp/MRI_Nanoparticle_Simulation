 *          of the B_z field found at its center, or a boolean determining if it
 *          is close enough to a magnetic nanoparticle that the B field should

/*
 * Given a set of (dx, dy, dz) coordinates in the space [0, bound)^3 and a
 * number (the depth) of desired precision bits per coordinate, this function
 * generates a Morton code 3*depth bits in length by converting each of dx, dy,
 * and dz to an integer in the range [0, 2^depth) and interleaving their bits
 * to generate the form {x_n, y_n, z_n, x_n-1, ... z_2, x_1, y_1, z_1}. This is
 * the order in which the octree is vectorized, so index computations can now be
 * conducted without any conditional branching.
 *
 * NOTE: nodes of the octrees have their Morton codes initialized the same way
 * for the bottom 3*depth bits, but the (3*depth + 1)'th bit is always set.
 * This allows one to distinguish between nodes at different depths. Second,
 * the most significant bit of a node's Morton code will be set IF AND ONLY
 * IF it is a leaf node. Since there is one more level of navigation after
 * reaching a leaf (determining which of its 8 B field values to use), nodes
 * can be level 20 at the depest, with their B field "children" being the
 * only points of the tree occupying the 21st level.
